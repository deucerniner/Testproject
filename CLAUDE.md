# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a test project repository containing four empty project directories:

- `HTMLTestProject/` - Empty directory intended for HTML-based projects
- `JSTestProject/` - Empty directory intended for JavaScript-based projects  
- `PythonTestProject/` - Empty directory intended for Python-based projects
- `Test/` - Empty directory for general testing purposes

## Development Setup

This appears to be a template or scaffolding repository with no active code or configuration files. Each subdirectory is currently empty and ready for project initialization.

## Notes for Future Development

- No build systems, package managers, or development tools are currently configured
- No existing code architecture to follow
- When working in specific subdirectories, establish appropriate tooling based on the technology stack:
  - For `JSTestProject/`: Consider adding package.json, build tools, and testing frameworks
  - For `PythonTestProject/`: Consider adding requirements.txt, virtual environment setup, and testing frameworks  
  - For `HTMLTestProject/`: Consider adding appropriate web development tooling
  - For `Test/`: Use as needed for experimental or testing code

## Git Status

This directory is not currently a git repository.
